# Privacy Policy

Cineaste App does not collect any personal information.

## Third party dependency: Google Nearby

You can start a movie night via [`Google Nearby Messages`][nearbyLink]. Therefore you are asked to grant permission for using Nearby and for accessing microphone. Nearby uses the microphone, bluetooth and your wifi connection to search for nearby devices and matches their watchlist with yours. As a result you can see which movie is the most interested one for you and your friends.

### Permissions
#### Microphone access

When starting a movie night the microphone will only be used to discover nearby devices with which you can compare your movie lists. 

#### Bluetooth access

When starting a movie night bluetooth will only be used to discover nearby devices with which you can compare your movie lists

### Shared data with nearby devices

The data shared with nearby devices is: 
* Your username (you are asked to set that in the app)
* The vendor id to indentify your device (see [Apple Documentation][vendorId])
* The movies on your watchlist, consisting of movie id, title, and posterPath
